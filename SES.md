# AMAZON SES

- It is for receiving and sending emails
- resources setting up our SMTP servers for sending that one congratulatory email to the user who newly signed up to our website.

Setups:

1. Log in to your AWS account at `aws.amazon.com` or create one if you haven’t yet.
2. Search for Simple Email Service in your preferred AWS region
3. On the SES homepage, click on the “Email Addresses” option
   Add the email you want to use for sending an email. You will receive an email from no-reply-aws@amazon.com to verify the email. Click on the URL in the mail to verify (your verified email address will be used as the ‘from’ address for the emails you send using AWS-SES).
